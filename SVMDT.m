function SVMDT(trainData,testData)

% Decision Tree using Support Vector Machine for classification

% Hybrid model of SVM and DT is used to achieve the good accuracy of SVM 
% with reduction of time using DT.

%--------------Training Phase----------------------------------------------

% Data to be used for training

[m1,n1] = size(trainData);
data1   = trainData(:,2:n1);
target1 = trainData(:,1);

% SVM is soft margin SVM classification problem with cost = 50

alph = svm_struct.sv_coef;              % Alpha values
weight = sv'*alph;                      % Weight vector
bias = -svm_struct.rho;                 % Bias value

%-----------------Testing Phase--------------------------------------------

% To speed up SVMs in testing phase, conventional approach was reducing the 
% no. of support vectors, but SVMDT aims at "reducing no. of test datapoints" 
% that requires SVM's decision.

% In order to achieve this goal, we consider only those points which are close 
% to decision hyperplane for SVM classification.
